        <h2>Old Goa Churches</h2>
        <p>These UNESCO sites face threats from weathering and insufficient upkeep. Despite being protected, many areas are closed or under repair due to lack of funds and attention. Over the centuries, these monuments have endured Goa’s harsh monsoon climate, leading to:

      To preserve the Old Goa churches and protect their historical significance, a multi-pronged approach is needed. Greater community involvement can play a vital role—local residents, parish members, and volunteers can assist in regular maintenance and awareness campaigns. Educational programs, such as heritage walks and school partnerships, can instill a sense of pride and responsibility in younger generations. Additionally, increased government funding and stronger collaboration between the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), heritage NGOs, and private organizations can help ensure timely restoration and conservation</p>
